# Machine learning libraries and how they work

> I created this repository to overcome the inertia between reading and implementing Machine learning in programming. 

In all programming language we have different libraries that help us to achieve our goals and to get our task done quickly, we should know what functionality they provide and how it can be used.

In this I have tried to add all examples which I suggest you should try and modify to get better understanding how they work and how ca they help you to get your idea in action.

Most common programming language used for ML is Python, so I will add most of the libraries from python and later will try to add libs from other programming language which can help you achieve same output.
